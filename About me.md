Hey! I am Akhil Theerthala, an applied scientist who started my data science and Machine Leanring journey roughly in 2022. It was a pleasure till now. I always wanted to learn more and keep notes of everything I read, so I thought, GitHub would be the best place to keep them available for me to easily get back to them. Hope you find it fun! Thanks!
